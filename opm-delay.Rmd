From government workers to bartenders, much of Washington depends on the status of the Federal Government. This chart will help the district know when to look for that all important email. So stay up past 10PM and then set your alarm for 4am, folks!

```{r}

#set libraries

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(stringr)

#Data comes from @zubakskees gist: https://gist.github.com/chriszs/490d9930ac0421f84857 - slightly modified by me. 12-hr changed to 24 hour times.
opm <- read.csv("opmoperatingstatus.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

#change date format to POSIXct
opm$ptime <- strptime(opm$time, format = "%H:%M")

#plot the data
qplot(ptime, status, data=opm)

#plot the data with color!
opmplot <- ggplot(data=opm, aes(ptime, year)) + geom_point(aes(color=status)) + scale_colour_manual(values=c("red", "yellow", "green"))
opmplot






```
